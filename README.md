# repo-horiseon-accessibility

## Description

A simple refactoring of Horiseon html and css to meet accessibility criteria.

- I did a series of small fixes to optimize the site for  general user accessibility.
- I resolved and compiled many unnecessary lines of code for a cleaner, more organized code. I also added missing alt tags to image links for screen reader accessability.
- I learned how to pull, commit and push my repository and work across multiple machines. 

I used HTML and CSS to accomplish this project.

## Usage

Simply open the page, and you will find that it looks and functions as it originally had. Only upon examining the source code will you see the work that has been done.
